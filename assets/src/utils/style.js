    OK, so what is this? Well, I _wanted_ atomic CSS classes and CSS modules, but Webpack was
    being a PITA and I couldn't quite get both working together, and even when I felt like I was
    getting close everything was basically just getting special-cased. Instead, this is what I've
    come up with. This is a tagged template literal function. It essentially parses a template
    string. It's meant to be used for CSS classes:
        css`bgRed p1 heightAll` === "bgRed_akhsjkdhasjd p1_wierpweior heightAll_xcnvxmnv"
    What's happening is the tagged template literal function is turning our normal, human-readable
    atomic CSS names into the hashed up versions. I'm actually pretty into this because it means
    we have one way of dealing with CSS (it's all CSS modules) _and_ we get something very much like
    atomic CSS.
    Note: This file is Webpack aliased to <style> so it can be used more easily.
